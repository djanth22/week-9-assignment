## reflection

# user requirements

- 🎯 Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk.
- 🎯 Create and display an error page if the user visits a user profile that doesn’t exist.
- 🎯 Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive or something similar (e.g. use of another library to enhance UX).
- 🎯 Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route (e.g. /user/[userId]).
- 🎯 Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the user’s profile page.

# my reflection

what requirements I achieved

- my user can sign in or sign up using clerk
- i managed to get an accordian element from daisy ui working (radix ui wasnt working)
- users have a very basic profile where then can add a bio, users, posts, likes anf followers are all respectively stored in their own tables in the database
- users posts are associated with their clerk id

I didnt manage to get my error page working and had run out of time to mess with it and so I removed it, but this was one of the requirements I haven't been able to do. I lost a lot of time on this assignment due to unforseen circumstances but i had managed to get likes, dislikes, delete buttons and even a simple follow system more or less working which i'm happy with.
