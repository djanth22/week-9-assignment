# user requirements

- 🎯 Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk.
- 🎯 Create and display an error page if the user visits a user profile that doesn’t exist.
- 🎯 Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive or something similar (e.g. use of another library to enhance UX).
- 🎯 Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route (e.g. /user/[userId]).
- 🎯 Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the user’s profile page.
